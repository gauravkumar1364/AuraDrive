# Permission System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Notification Permission Not Working
**Problem:** Notification permission was not requesting properly on Android 13+

**Solution:**
- Added `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission to AndroidManifest.xml
- Improved error handling in permission request logic
- Added fallback for older Android versions (< 13) where notifications don't need explicit permission
- Added try-catch to handle platforms where notification permission isn't available

### 2. ✅ Redundant Permission Requests
**Problem:** App was requesting permissions even when already granted

**Solution:**
- Added status check before requesting each permission
- Only show permission dialog if permission is not yet granted
- If already granted, just update the UI state without showing dialog

## Changes Made

### AndroidManifest.xml
Added two new permissions:
```xml
<!-- Background location for "Always On" tracking -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />

<!-- Notification permission for Android 13+ (API 33+) -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
```

### permissions_screen.dart

#### Enhanced Permission Checking
Each permission now checks multiple related permissions:

**Location:**
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` OR
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`

**Bluetooth:**
- `BLUETOOTH` OR
- `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` AND `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` (Android 12+)

**Notification:**
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+)
- Fallback: Auto-grant on older versions

#### Smart Permission Request Logic

**Before requesting, the app now:**
1. ✅ Checks if permission is already granted → Update UI only
2. ✅ Checks if permission is permanently denied → Show settings dialog
3. ✅ Only shows permission dialog if status is "denied" (not asked yet)

#### Request Flow Examples

**Location Permission:**
```dart
1. Check current status
2. If already granted → Just request background location
3. If permanently denied → Show "Go to Settings" dialog
4. If denied → Show permission request dialog
5. After granted → Request background location automatically
```

**Bluetooth Permission:**
```dart
1. Check bluetooth, scan, and connect status
2. If all granted → Just update UI
3. If permanently denied → Show settings dialog
4. If denied → Request bluetooth first
5. Then request scan and connect permissions
```

**Notification Permission:**
```dart
1. Check current status
2. If already granted → Just update UI
3. If permanently denied → Show settings dialog
4. If denied → Request permission
5. If on Android < 13 → Auto-grant (not needed)
6. If permission API unavailable → Auto-grant with try-catch
```

## Testing Notes

### Android 13+ (API 33+)
- All three permissions will show system dialogs
- Notification permission works correctly
- Background location requires two-step process

### Android 12 (API 31-32)
- Bluetooth Scan/Connect permissions required
- Notification permission auto-granted
- Background location requires two-step process

### Android 11 and below
- Standard bluetooth permission only
- Notification permission auto-granted
- Background location may show in single dialog

## User Experience Improvements

1. **No Duplicate Dialogs** - Won't ask for permissions multiple times
2. **Smart Defaults** - Auto-grants when platform doesn't need explicit permission
3. **Clear Feedback** - Shows "Granted" badge immediately when permission is given
4. **Settings Shortcut** - Easy way to fix permanently denied permissions
5. **Progressive Requests** - Requests related permissions in sequence

## Button Behavior

The "Grant" buttons now:
- ✅ Check permission status first
- ✅ Only show dialog if needed
- ✅ Update UI immediately if already granted
- ✅ Show settings dialog if permanently denied
- ✅ Handle platform-specific quirks gracefully

## Continue Button Logic

The continue button:
- Stays **gray (disabled)** until all three permissions are granted
- Turns **blue (enabled)** when ready to proceed
- Shows **error message** if user tries to continue without all permissions
- Proceeds to **phone auth screen** when all permissions granted
