# Auto-Connect & Real-Time Location Sharing

## Overview
Enhanced BLE mesh network for automatic, fast connections and real-time location sharing between AuraDrive apps.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Fast Automatic Connections
- **10-second scan intervals** (previously 30s) for faster device discovery
- **5-second reconnection attempts** (previously 15s) for quick recovery
- **Auto-connect enabled** for persistent connections
- **Priority-based connections** - Strongest signal (RSSI) devices connected first
- **Support for up to 20 devices** (previously 8)
- **5 connection attempts** per device (previously 3)

### 📡 Real-Time Location Sharing
- **Automatic position broadcasting** to all connected devices
- **Smart update filtering** - Only broadcasts significant position changes:
  - Movement > 1 meter OR
  - Heading change > 5 degrees
- **BLE notifications** for instant updates (no polling)
- **Bidirectional sharing** - All connected devices share positions
- **Live map updates** - Peer positions update in real-time

### 🎯 Enhanced Signal Range
- **-85 dBm threshold** (previously -80 dBm)
- Connects to devices further away
- Better coverage in urban environments

## How It Works

### Connection Flow
```
App Start
    ↓
Initialize BLE
    ↓
Start Advertising (NaviSafe-XXXX)
    ↓
Start Scanning (every 10s)
    ↓
Discover Devices
    ↓
Sort by Signal Strength (RSSI)
    ↓
Auto-Connect (strongest first)
    ↓

```

### Position Broadcasting
```
GPS Update
    ↓
Check Position Change
    ↓
Significant? (>1m or >5° heading)
    ↓
YES → Broadcast to all connected devices
    ↓
Peers receive via BLE notification
    ↓
Peers update their maps instantly
```

## Visual Indicators on Map

### Your Vehicle (Blue)
- 🔵 Blue circle with white navigation arrow
- Rotates based on phone's heading
- Smooth 300ms animation
- Glowing shadow effect

### Connected Vehicles (Green/Red)
- 🟢 **Green**: Safe distance (> 25m)
  - Green gradient circle
  - White navigation arrow showing heading
  - Subtle glow
- 🔴 **Red**: Too close! (< 25m)
  - Red gradient circle
  - White navigation arrow
  - Warning glow
  - Collision risk indicator

### Real-Time Updates
- Positions update **every 500ms** minimum
- **Instant** updates when position changes significantly
- **Smooth animations** for heading changes
- **No lag** - BLE notifications, not polling

## Configuration

### Scan Settings
```dart
// In mesh_network_service.dart
static const Duration _scanInterval = Duration(seconds: 10);
static const Duration _reconnectInterval = Duration(seconds: 5);
```

### Connection Limits
```dart
int _maxClusterSize = 20; // Max connected devices
static const int minRssiThreshold = -85; // Signal strength threshold
static const int maxConnectionAttempts = 5; // Retry count
```

### Position Update Threshold
```dart
// Only broadcast if moved > 1m or heading changed > 5°
if (distance < 1.0 && headingDiff < 5.0) {
  return true; // Skip broadcast to save battery
}
```

## Debug Output

### Connection Messages
```
🚀 Auto-connecting to NaviSafe device NaviSafe-ABC123...
🔗 Connecting to NaviSafe-ABC123 (12:34:56:78:90:AB)...
✅ Connected to NaviSafe-ABC123
🔍 Discovering services...
✅ NaviSafe service found
✅ Device 12:34:56:78:90:AB fully connected and monitoring
```

### Position Sharing
```
📤 Broadcasted position to 3 devices
📍 Received position from 12:34:56:78:90:AB: 28.6139, 77.2090
📡 No connected devices to broadcast position
```

### Connection Status
```
⚠️ Device 12:34:56:78:90:AB disconnected
❌ Failed to connect to NaviSafe-XYZ789
✅ Reconnected to device successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### Devices Not Connecting?

#### 1. Check Bluetooth Permissions
- Android 12+: Bluetooth Scan, Connect, Advertise
- Location permission required for BLE scanning

#### 2. Enable Location Services
- Must be ON for BLE to work
- Use "High Accuracy" mode

#### 3. Check Device Proximity
- Devices should be within ~30 meters
- RSSI must be > -85 dBm
- Remove obstacles (walls, metal objects)

#### 4. Verify Both Apps Running
- Both devices must have AuraDrive open
- Both must be on Navigation screen
- Check "Network" status shows devices

#### 5. Check Logs
```
🔍 Look for:
- "Added NaviSafe device" - Device discovered
- "Auto-connecting" - Connection attempt
- "Connected to" - Success
- "fully connected and monitoring" - Ready
```

### Positions Not Updating?

#### 1. Check GPS Signal
- Both devices need GPS lock
- Wait 10-30 seconds for first fix
- Check speed display shows movement

#### 2. Verify Connection
- Network status should show "X devices"
- Markers should appear on map (green/red circles)

#### 3. Move the Device
- Position only broadcasts on significant movement (>1m)
- Or heading change (>5°)
- Try walking/driving to test

#### 4. Check Debug Output
```
Look for:
📤 "Broadcasted position to X devices"
📍 "Received position from..."
```

### Devices Disconnecting?

#### 1. Battery Optimization
- Disable battery optimization for AuraDrive
- Settings → Apps → AuraDrive → Battery → Unrestricted

#### 2. Background Restrictions
- Allow app to run in background
- Don't "Force Stop" the app

#### 3. Signal Interference
- Move away from WiFi routers
- Avoid crowded BLE environments
- Remove other BLE devices

### BLE Service UUID
```
NaviSafe Service: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
Position Characteristic: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abd
Vehicle Data Characteristic: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abe
```

### Device Advertising
```
Service: NaviSafe
Name: NaviSafe-XXXXXXXX (8-char UUID)
Manufacturer ID: 0x0000
Manufacturer Data: App version
```

### Position Data Format
```json
{
  "deviceId": "abc123",
  "latitude": 28.6139,
  "longitude": 77.2090,
  "altitude": 216.5,
  "accuracy": 8.5,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:30:45.123Z",
  "speed": 15.5,
  "heading": 45.0,
  "positioningMode": "GPS"
}
```

### Update Algorithm
```dart
1. GPS provides new position
2. Calculate distance from last broadcast
3. Calculate heading difference
4. If (distance > 1m OR headingDiff > 5°):
   - Encode position to JSON
   - Broadcast to all connected devices
   - Update last broadcast position
5. Else: Skip (battery saving)
```

## Best Practices

### For Drivers
1. **Start app before trip** - Give time for connections
2. **Keep screen on** during navigation - Prevents service pause
3. **Good GPS signal** - Park in open area to establish lock
4. **Within range** - Stay < 30m for initial pairing

### For Developers
1. **Test with 2+ devices** - Real BLE connections
2. **Monitor debug output** - Check connection logs
3. **Test edge cases** - Disconnection, reconnection, range limits
4. **Battery testing** - Run for extended periods

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Mesh routing for extended range
- [ ] Position prediction during GPS loss
- [ ] Speed synchronization
- [ ] Route sharing
- [ ] Group navigation
- [ ] Collision prediction algorithms
- [ ] Voice alerts for nearby vehicles
- [ ] Historical position trails

## Safety Notes
⚠️ **Important**:
- This is a driver assistance feature
- **Do not rely solely on this system**
- Always use visual confirmation
- Follow traffic rules
- Maintain safe following distances
- System is supplementary to safe driving practices
