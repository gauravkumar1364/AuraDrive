# Routing System Fix

## Problem
The route line on the map was showing a **straight line** between source and destination, not following actual roads. This made navigation unrealistic and confusing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Routing Service (`lib/services/routing_service.dart`)
- Uses **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)** - a free, open-source routing engine
- No API key required
- Calculates real road-based routes
- Features:
  - `getRoute()` - Returns list of LatLng points following actual roads
  - `getRouteInfo()` - Returns route with distance and duration
  - Automatic fallback to straight line if API fails
  - 10-second timeout for reliability

### 2. Updated Navigation Screen
**New Features:**
- Real-time route calculation when source/destination is set
- Loading indicator while calculating route
- Route information banner showing:
  - Total distance (e.g., "15.2 km")
  - Estimated duration (e.g., "25m")
  - Close button to clear route
- Route line now follows actual roads on the map

**Technical Changes:**
```dart
// Added variables:
List<LatLng> _routePoints = [];        // Actual road points
RouteInfo? _routeInfo;                 // Distance & duration
RoutingService _routingService;         // Routing engine
bool _isCalculatingRoute = false;      // Loading state

// Updated PolylineLayer to use _routePoints instead of straight line
```

### 3. How It Works

**Before:**
```
Source ──────────────────────► Destination
        (straight line)
```

**After:**
```
Source ─┐
        └──┐
           └─┐
             └──┐  (follows roads, highways, turns)
                └─► Destination
```

## Usage

1. **Tap search icon** (🔍) in top bar
2. **Enter locations:**
   - Source: "IIT Delhi" or "Connaught Place"
   - Destination: "India Gate" or "Red Fort"
3. **Tap "Set Route"**
4. Watch as the route calculates and displays on map following actual roads
5. Route info banner shows: **"15.2 km • 25m"**

## Technical Details

### OSRM API Endpoint
```
https://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/{lon1},{lat1};{lon2},{lat2}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "code": "Ok",
  "routes": [{
    "geometry": {
      "coordinates": [[lon1, lat1], [lon2, lat2], ...]
    },
    "distance": 15243.5,  // meters
    "duration": 1524.3    // seconds
  }]
}
```

### Features
- ✅ Follows actual roads
- ✅ Respects one-way streets
- ✅ Uses real traffic routing algorithms
- ✅ Free and open-source
- ✅ No API key required
- ✅ Works worldwide
- ✅ Automatic fallback if offline

## Dependencies Added
```yaml
http: ^1.1.0  # For API requests to OSRM
```

## Files Modified
1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added http package
2. `lib/services/routing_service.dart` - New routing service
3. `lib/screens/navigation_screen.dart` - Integrated routing

## Testing
Try these route combinations:
- **IIT Delhi → India Gate** (~15 km)
- **Connaught Place → Red Fort** (~5 km)
- **DTU → Qutub Minar** (~20 km)

You'll see the route now follows actual Delhi roads! 🚗🗺️
