## Technical Architecture

### Hardware Utilization
| Hardware | Purpose | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| BLE 4.0+ | Mesh networking, Doppler analysis | `ble_mesh_service.dart` |
| Wi-Fi | VANET communication (P2P) | `vanet_service.dart` |
| GPS | Primary positioning | `kalman_gps_service.dart` |
| Accelerometer | Velocity prediction | `kalman_gps_service.dart` |
| Gyroscope | Rotation detection | `kalman_gps_service.dart` |
| Magnetometer | Heading estimation | `kalman_gps_service.dart` |

### Key Algorithms

#### 1. Kalman Filtering
```dart
State: [X, Y, Vx, Vy]
Prediction: state += velocity * dt + 0.5 * acceleration * dt²
Update: state += kalman_gain * (measurement - predicted)
```

#### 2. Doppler Speed Estimation
```dart
RSSI Trend → Distance Change → Velocity
Distance = d0 * 10^((RSSI_ref - RSSI) / (10 * n))
Velocity = (d2 - d1) / dt
```

#### 3. Multi-Armed Bandit (Coordinator Selection)
```dart
Epsilon-greedy:
  if random() < epsilon: select_random()
  else: select_best_based_on(battery, rewards, signal, stability)
```

#### 4. Collision Risk Assessment
```dart
Risk = 0.4 * distance_risk + 0.3 * speed_risk + 0.3 * trajectory_risk
TTC = distance / closing_speed
CPA = closest_point_of_approach(trajectories)
```

## Performance Characteristics
