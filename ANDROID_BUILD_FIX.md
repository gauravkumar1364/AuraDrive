# Fix for Android NDK and Build Issues

## Problem
The Android build is failing due to:
1. NDK (Native Development Kit) download issues
2. Missing Android cmdline-tools
3. Uneaccepted Android licenses

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Android Environment (Recommended for full development)

1. **Enable Developer Mode (for symlinks):**
   ```
   start ms-settings:developers
   ```
   Enable "Developer Mode" in Windows settings.

2. **Accept Android Licenses:**
   ```
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```
   Accept all Android SDK licenses.

3. **Install Android Command Line Tools:**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK
   - Click on "SDK Tools" tab
   - Check "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)"
   - Click Apply and install

### Option 2: Use Web Version (Current working solution)

The app successfully builds for web and can be tested using:
```bash
flutter build web
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Option 3: Quick Android Fix (For immediate testing)

We've already removed the NDK requirement from build.gradle.kts. To test on Android without full setup:

1. Use a physical Android device or emulator
2. Run with forced build:
   ```bash
   flutter run --no-enable-android-embedding-v2
   ```

## Current Status

✅ **Web Build**: Working perfectly
✅ **Code Quality**: All Dart code compiles successfully
✅ **OpenStreetMap**: Integrated and functional
❌ **Android Build**: Requires environment setup
❌ **iOS Build**: Not tested (requires macOS)

## Recommendation

For immediate testing and development, use the web version. The NaviSafe app will work fully in a web browser with all features except:
- Actual GNSS positioning (will use browser geolocation)
- Bluetooth LE mesh networking (web limitation)
- IMU sensor data (web limitation)

All UI components, OpenStreetMap integration, and core logic are fully functional on web.
