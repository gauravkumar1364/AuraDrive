# Safe Autonomous Navigation Using Mobile Phone Measurements

## üîé Pain Points & Core Understanding

**Exact Problem:**  
Develop a low-cost, sensor-light positioning system for vehicles‚Äîleveraging raw GNSS and inertial data from Android phones‚Äîto detect proximity, predict collisions, and provide real-time warnings without expensive LIDAR or dedicated proximity sensors.

**Root Causes:**  
- High cost and complexity of LIDAR/RADAR systems  
- Limited infrastructure for V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication  
- GNSS signal degradation in urban canyons and indoors  
- Lack of fusion algorithms optimized for smartphone sensor noise

**Primary Stakeholders:**  
- Commuters and fleet operators  
- Automotive OEMs targeting cost-sensitive markets  
- Smart city planners and traffic authorities  
- Hackathon participants evaluating feasibility of mobile-based sensing

**Current Challenges & Inefficiencies:**  
- Smartphone GNSS and IMU measurements suffer multipath, drift, and latency  
- Ad-hoc data sharing (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) has bandwidth and range limits  
- Centralized servers introduce latency and single-point failures  
- Indoor and urban environments lack reliable reference signals

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feasibility of Execution

**Prototype in Timeline?**  
Yes‚Äîbasic V2V data exchange and collision warning prototypes can be built within 48‚Äì72 hours using available SDKs.

**Technical Requirements:**  
- Android APIs: GNSS Raw Measurements, SensorManager (accelerometer, gyroscope)  
- Networking: BLE mesh or Wi-Fi Direct for peer discovery and data exchange  
- Optional: Lightweight backend (Node.js/Flask) for coordination if direct mesh is insufficient  
- Data fusion libraries: RTKLIB or custom Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)  
- Hardware: ‚â•‚Äâ3 Android phones; portable chargers; tripods for static base stations

**Potential Blockers:**  
- **Data Availability:** Inconsistent GNSS quality on low-end devices  
- **Regulations:** Spectrum limits for ad-hoc radio; privacy of location sharing  
- **Scaling:** Real-time mesh network reliability with >‚Äâ10 nodes  
- **Indoor Signals:** Absence of GNSS‚Äîrequires use of phones as anchor beacons

**MVP to Impress Evaluators:**  
- Real-time proximity alerts between two moving phones  
- Dynamic adjustment of safe-distance thresholds based on fused sensor accuracy  
- Optional indoor demo: static phones broadcasting pseudorange corrections
