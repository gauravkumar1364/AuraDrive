# How AuraDrive Works - Complete System Overview

## üöó App Purpose
**AuraDrive** (also branded as **NaviSafe**) is an autonomous vehicle safety and navigation app that uses:
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) mesh networking** to connect nearby vehicles
- **High-precision GPS/GNSS** for real-time location tracking
- **Accelerometer sensors** for collision detection
- **Real-time position sharing** between connected vehicles
- **OpenStreetMap** for navigation and routing

## üì± App Flow - User Journey

### 1. **App Launch** üöÄ
```
main.dart ‚Üí Splash Screen ‚Üí Permissions Screen ‚Üí Navigation Screen
```

**What Happens:**
- App initializes 3 core services:
  - `GnssService` - GPS positioning
  - `MeshNetworkService` - BLE device connectivity
  - `AccelerometerCollisionService` - Crash detection
- Services are provided via `Provider` state management (available to all screens)

### 2. **Permissions Screen** üîê
**Required Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ Location (for GPS)
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth Scan (to discover nearby devices)
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth Connect (to connect to devices)
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth Advertise (to broadcast own device)

**Why Needed:**
- Location: Get real-time GPS coordinates
- Bluetooth: Create mesh network with other AuraDrive users

### 3. **Navigation Screen** üó∫Ô∏è
**Main App Interface** - Where all the magic happens!

## üîß Core Services - The Engine

### **Service 1: GNSS Service** üìç
**File:** `lib/services/gnss_service.dart`

**What It Does:**
- Gets your current GPS position continuously
- Provides high-accuracy positioning (bestForNavigation mode)
- Updates position every second (distanceFilter: 0)
- Calculates speed, heading, and accuracy

**Key Features:**
- Desktop simulation mode (for testing on Windows/Mac)
- Real-time position streaming
- Quality metrics (satellite count, accuracy)

**How It Works:**
```dart
// Initialize GPS
gnssService.initialize()

// Start tracking
gnssService.startPositioning()

// Listen to position updates
gnssService.positionStream.listen((position) {
  // Update map with new position
  // Share position via BLE
  // Update speed display
});
```

**Position Data Includes:**
- Latitude, Longitude
- Speed (km/h)
- Heading (direction in degrees)
- Accuracy (meters)
- Timestamp

---

### **Service 2: Mesh Network Service** üì°
**File:** `lib/services/mesh_network_service.dart`

**What It Does:**
- Creates a BLE mesh network of nearby AuraDrive devices
- Automatically discovers and connects to other users
- Shares your position with connected devices
- Receives positions from other vehicles

**BLE Architecture:**

#### **Advertising (Broadcasting):**
Every AuraDrive device advertises itself:
```
Service UUID: Generated from package name (unique to AuraDrive)
Device Name: "NaviSafe-XXXXXXXX" (random 8-char ID)
Manufacturer Data: App version
```

#### **Scanning (Discovery):**
Every 10 seconds, app scans for:
- Devices with AuraDrive service UUID
- Devices with name starting "NaviSafe"
- RSSI ‚â• -79 dBm (30% signal strength minimum)

#### **Auto-Connection:**
When a NaviSafe device is found:
1. Check if already connected
2. Check if under max connections (20 devices)
3. Check connection attempts < 5
4. Auto-connect in background
5. Subscribe to position updates

#### **Position Sharing:**
Connected devices share data via BLE Characteristics:
```
Position Characteristic UUID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abd
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Speed
- Heading
- Timestamp
- Device ID

Vehicle Data Characteristic UUID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abe
- Vehicle type
- Speed
- Acceleration
- Direction
```

**Broadcasting Strategy:**
- Sends position every 500ms
- Only if position changed >1m OR heading changed >5¬∞
- Uses `withoutResponse` mode for speed
- Smart filtering to save battery

**How It Works:**
```dart
// Initialize mesh network
meshService.initialize()

// Start advertising this device
meshService._attemptAdvertising()

// Start scanning for other devices
meshService.startScanning()

// Auto-connect to discovered NaviSafe devices
meshService.connectToDevice(deviceId)

// Broadcast your position
meshService.broadcastPositionData(positionData)

// Receive peer positions
meshService.positionReceivedStream.listen((peerPosition) {
  // Show peer vehicle on map
});
```

**Connection Management:**
- Max 20 simultaneous connections
- RSSI threshold: -79 dBm (30% signal, ~45m range)
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Smart retry (max 5 attempts)

---

### **Service 3: Accelerometer Collision Service** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File:** `lib/services/accelerometer_collision_service.dart`

**What It Does:**
- Monitors phone's accelerometer in real-time
- Detects crashes, hard braking, sharp turns
- Generates visual/audio alerts

**Detection Thresholds:**
- **Crash:** 12G force
- **Hard Braking:** 1.0G deceleration
- **Sharp Turn:** 0.8G lateral force
- **Motion Threshold:** 0.3G minimum (ignore small bumps)

**Alert Types:**
```dart
- "crash" ‚Üí Critical severity ‚Üí Red alert
- "braking" ‚Üí High severity ‚Üí Orange warning
- "turn" ‚Üí Medium severity ‚Üí Yellow caution
```

**How It Works:**
```dart
// Start monitoring
collisionService.startMonitoring()

// Listen for alerts
collisionService.alertStream.listen((alert) {
  // Show collision warning dialog
  // Log event
  // Notify nearby vehicles (future feature)
});
```

**Smoothing Algorithm:**
- Keeps 10-sample history
- Averages readings to reduce noise
- Cooldown period between alerts (5 seconds)

## üåê BLE Mesh Network - Device Discovery

### **How Devices Find Each Other:**

**Device A (Your Phone):**
```
1. Starts advertising: "NaviSafe-ABC123"
2. Starts scanning for other NaviSafe devices
3. Finds Device B: "NaviSafe-XYZ789" (RSSI: -65)
4. Auto-connects to Device B
5. Subscribes to Device B's position characteristic
6. Starts receiving Device B's location every 500ms
```

**Device B (Other User's Phone):**
```
1. Starts advertising: "NaviSafe-XYZ789"
2. Finds Device A: "NaviSafe-ABC123" (RSSI: -65)
3. Auto-connects to Device A
4. Subscribes to Device A's position characteristic
5. Both devices now share positions in real-time!
```

### **What You See:**
- Device B appears as a marker on your map
- Marker moves in real-time as Device B moves
- Distance calculated continuously
- Alert if Device B gets <50m (collision zone)

---

## üìç Position Sharing Protocol

### **Data Format (JSON over BLE):**
```json
{
  "deviceId": "abc123...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:34:56.789Z",
  "latitude": 28.7041,
  "longitude": 77.1025,
  "accuracy": 5.2,
  "speed": 45.3,
  "heading": 90.0
}
```

### **Broadcast Frequency:**
- **Normal:** Every 500ms
- **Smart Filter:** Only if moved >1m OR turned >5¬∞
- **Battery Saver:** Reduces unnecessary transmissions

### **Reception:**
```dart
meshService.positionReceivedStream.listen((peerPosition) {
  // Update peer marker on map
  _peerPositions[peerPosition.deviceId] = LatLng(
    peerPosition.latitude,
    peerPosition.longitude,
  );
  
  // Calculate distance to peer
  double distance = calculateDistance(
    _currentPosition,
    peerPosition,
  );
  
  // Show warning if too close
  if (distance < 50.0) {
    showCollisionWarning();
  }
});
```

minRssiThreshold = -79;  // 30% signal strength
maxClusterSize = 20;     // Max 20 connected devices
maxConnectionAttempts = 5; // Retry 5 times
connectionTimeout = 30s;  // 30 second timeout
scanInterval = 10s;      // Scan every 10 seconds
