# Mobile USB Debugging Solution for NaviSafe

## Current Issue
The Android build is failing due to NDK (Native Development Kit) requirements, even though NaviSafe doesn't use native C/C++ code.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Install NDK (Recommended for full Android development)
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools → SDK Manager
3. Click on "SDK Tools" tab
4. Check "NDK (Side by side)" - version 27.0.12077973
5. Click Apply and install
6. Then run: `flutter run -d R9ZN70ZR9KE`

### Option 2: Use Web Version on Mobile Browser
Since the web build works perfectly, you can test on mobile browser:
1. Run: `flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8080`
2. On your mobile device, open browser and go to: `http://[YOUR_PC_IP]:8080`
3. All NaviSafe features work except platform-specific ones (BLE, precise GNSS)

### Option 3: Flutter Profile Build (Sometimes bypasses NDK)
```bash
flutter build apk --profile
flutter install --device-id=R9ZN70ZR9KE
```

### Option 4: Enable Developer Mode for Symlinks
1. Run: `start ms-settings:developers`
2. Enable "Developer Mode"
3. Try building again: `flutter run -d R9ZN70ZR9KE`
