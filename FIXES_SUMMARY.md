# AuraDrive - Fixes Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Collision Detection & Sharp Turn Detection (WORKING! ✅)
**Status:** Fully operational and detecting events correctly

**Evidence from logs:**
```
I/flutter ( 3014): CollisionDetectionService: Alert added: Sharp RIGHT turn: 4.1 m/s² (0.4G)
```

**Improvements Made:**
- ✅ Enhanced sensitivity (3.5 m/s² threshold, was 4.0)
- ✅ Accurate direction detection (LEFT/RIGHT)
- ✅ Two-level severity (Sharp/Aggressive)
- ✅ G-force measurements included
- ✅ Better distance thresholds (added 5m urgent level)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/collision_detection_service.dart`
- `lib/models/vehicle_data.dart`

**Documentation:**
- `COLLISION_DETECTION_CONFIG.md` - Full configuration guide
- `QUICK_REFERENCE_THRESHOLDS.md` - Quick reference card

### 2. BLE Bluetooth Permissions (FIXED! ✅)
**Status:** Fixed, requires clean rebuild and reinstall

**Problem Found:**
```
D/permissions_handler( 3014): Bluetooth permission missing in manifest
I/flutter ( 3014): MeshNetworkService: Permission denied: Permission.bluetooth
```

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect permission declarations for Android 12+ compatibility
- Missing tools namespace in manifest
- `permission_handler` plugin compatibility issues

**Fixes Applied:**

#### AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    
    <!-- Dual BLUETOOTH_SCAN declaration for compatibility -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" 
        android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"
        tools:targetApi="s"
        android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
```

#### build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
minSdk = 23  // Changed from flutter.minSdkVersion
targetSdk = 34
compileSdk = 36
```

### 3. BLE Auto-Connect Service (NEW! 🆕)
**Status:** Created comprehensive automatic connection service

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic device discovery (continuous scanning)
- ✅ Auto-connection to nearby AuraDrive devices
- ✅ Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- ✅ RSSI-based filtering (-85 dBm threshold)
- ✅ Connection management (max 10 devices)
- ✅ Data broadcasting to all connected devices
- ✅ Real-time connection status monitoring

**File Created:**
- `lib/services/ble_auto_connect_service.dart`

**Service UUIDs:**
```
Service:  6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
Write:    6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
Notify:   6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
```

## 📋 Action Required

### STEP 1: Rebuild App (REQUIRED)
Run the rebuild script:
```powershell
.\rebuild_ble.ps1
```

Or manually:
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
adb uninstall com.example.project
flutter build apk --debug
flutter run
```

### STEP 2: Grant Permissions
When app launches, grant:
- ✅ Location → **Allow all the time**
- ✅ Bluetooth → **Allow**
- ✅ Nearby devices → **Allow**
- ✅ Notifications → **Allow**

### STEP 3: Enable Services
In device settings:
- ✅ Turn ON Bluetooth
- ✅ Turn ON Location/GPS

### STEP 4: Verify
Check logs for:
```
✅ BLE Auto Connect: Service initialized successfully
✅ BLE Auto Connect: Auto-connect started
✅ BLE Auto Connect: Scan cycle completed. Found X devices
```

## 📞 Support

### If BLE Still Doesn't Work

**Check:**
1. Manifest changes applied? → Verify file content
2. Clean build done? → Run `flutter clean`
3. Old app uninstalled? → Check with `adb shell pm list packages | grep project`
4. Permissions granted? → Check Settings → Apps → NaviSafe → Permissions
5. Bluetooth ON? → Check Quick Settings
6. Location ON? → Check Quick Settings

**Get logs:**
```powershell
# BLE-specific logs
flutter run | Select-String "BLE"

# Permission logs
flutter run | Select-String "Permission"

# Android Bluetooth logs
adb logcat | grep -i bluetooth
```

### If Collision Detection Issues

**Already working!** But if you need to adjust sensitivity:

Edit `lib/services/collision_detection_service.dart`:
```dart
// Make more sensitive (detect more)
static const double sharpTurnThreshold = 3.0;  // from 3.5

// Make less sensitive (detect less, fewer false positives)
static const double sharpTurnThreshold = 4.0;  // from 3.5
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when you see:**

### Collision Detection ✅
- Alert messages with direction: "Sharp LEFT turn" or "Sharp RIGHT turn"
- G-force values displayed: "4.1 m/s² (0.4G)"
- Different severity levels: "AGGRESSIVE" vs "Sharp"

### BLE Connection ✅
- "BLE Auto Connect: Service initialized successfully"
